# bitcrusher_project
Bit crushing project implemented on STM32 microcontroller in C
In this project, an audio signal is given as an input (using a male jack cable) to the OLIMEX Card. This signal is acquired by ADC by the micro controller, treated and then transmitted  by PWM as a new audio signal (using a female jack cable). The treatment of the signal is a degradation of its quality, this treatment is also known as BITCRUSHING. The user can switch the digital degradation level of the signal by pushing the push button of the OLIMEX.
